# Firewalls

Firewalls are often a first line of defense for an enterprise or home network. In this lab we will understand the fundamentals of firewalls, write firewall rules that configure its behavior and then test if the firewall performs as expected.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the basic operation of firewalls
- Configure and test the linux netfilter firewall using iptables
- Author and place firewall rules for a given scenario

### Cybersecurity First Principles
* __Minimization__: Minimization refers to having the least functionality necessary in a program or device. The goal of minimization is to simplify and decrease the number of ways that software can be exploited. This can include **turning off ports that are not needed**, reducing the amount of code running on a machine, and/or turning off unneeded features in an application. This lesson focuses specifically on turning off ports that aren't in use.


## Overview

The name firewall is inspired from its physical manifestation in construction which refers to walls that are designed to stop a fire from spreading.

![Firewall in a substation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Firewall_Electrical_Substation.jpg)

While these firewalls are "cool", we are interested in a different kind of firewall. Namely, the ones that protect internal networks from external networks. These kinds of firewalls allow us to control the flow of information between networks. Firewalls, __minimize__ the number of ways that internal networks and computers on them can be exploited. They also encourage __least functionality__ by turning off ports that are not needed. Firewalls can also drop network traffic that does not conform to expected patterns (such as malicious requests to an application server).

![network firewalls](img/firewall/networkfirewall.png)

All popular operating systems now come with a firewall installed. For server installations we will focus on the NETfilter packet filtering module built into the linux kernel itself. This module is configured using the `iptables` command issued in a terminal (see figure below). The iptables utility provides a lot of flexibility and control over the configuration of the firewall.

![iptables screenshot](img/firewall/iptables.png)

In order for two machines to communicate (such as a client talking to a server), there are many different __layers__ that are involved. Each of these layers is progressively lower level as you move downward. In general there are 7 layers:

- Application - The highest level layer where application data is handled (http/ftp/DHCP/SSH/SSL, etc)
- Presentation - often the same as the application level, sometimes acts as a translate between application and session
- Session - The layer that is used to form sessions between applications (often issues remote procedure calls (RPCs))
- Transport - One of the two layers that are foundational to the modern internet (TCP / UDP), this layer serves to transport packets from one host to another.
- Network - The second of the foundation layers for the modern internet (IP, IPv4, IPv6, IPSec, etc). This layer serves to transport packets between routers (often referred to as __packet forwarding__).
- Data Link - The biggest example of the data link layer is ethernet. It provides a protocol for exchanging data over a local network.
- and Physical - This layer is nothing but raw bits that underly the higher level interpretation of those bits at higher levels.

![network layers](https://s3.amazonaws.com/edu.cohesive.net/OSI-layer-model.gif)

### Question

Where in the network stack does it make the most sense to operate a packet filtering firewall, considering that it is connecting two different networks?

- [ ] Physical layer  
- [ ] Data link layer  
- [ ] Network layer and above  

Discussion:  
The headers on ethernet frames at the Data link layer and below are not useful for routing across networks. Firewalls rules are authored using routing information starting at the Network layer (also called the IP layer in the TCP/IP implemenation) and above, all the way to the application layer. Layer 3 packet-filtering firewalls are the simplest and most widely used.


### Firewall as a Collection of Valves

A Firewall can be understood as a collection of valves  

* Each valve/port corresponds to single service at the application level (e.g. http, ssh, https, smtp)
* Each valve can:  
  - Permit traffic in one or both directions  
  - Deny traffic  

![valves](img/firewall/valves.png)  

Here are three basic scenarios to keep in mind.  

First lets consider, **Ports 1 and 4**. These ports are open. Which means they permit packets from internal and external sources. So in the case of the TCP protocol, which forms explicit connections or circuits before transmitting data via a handshake mechanism, such connections can be externally or internally initiated.

In the case of **Port 2**, it allows all internally originating outgoing connections and related incoming traffic, but blocks all externally originating connection requests. That is, it permits packets from external sources only if they correspond to a “connection” initiated by an internal source. This restriction is useful when an internal web client initiates a web browsing request, then the firewall will allow the corresponding incoming response from an external webserver to pass through the firewall. 

Finally, **Port 3** is closed. Which means that it denies all traffic. A closed port may just drop the packets or send back a RST or "Reset" packet. From a security and resource consumption standpoint, it is always better to just drop the packet. Upon denial of access, no additional or useful information should be communicated back.



## Firewall Rules

Firewalls are configured using simple `if then` rules. In a packet filtering firewall, a rule says: `if a pattern based on packet source, destination, protocol, or service is a match THEN take the specified action`. Since there are many rules involved, the order of the rules matters. **A LOT!**

Rules are evaluated in order, starting with the first one at the top until a first match is discovered. If your top rule is very generic, i.e. matches almost every packet, then **none of the later specific rules will ever be evaluated**. So it best to start with rules that are the most restrictive (i.e rules that focus on to specific services and have a very small chance of interfering with other rules). After ordering by restrictiveness it is then best to order rules according to how well they match the majority of your network traffic. This minimizes the number of checks required to find a matching rule.

Always start firewall configuration with a _whitelisting_ philosophy, where you “Deny by default” and then allow only specific information flows. This means, start the firewall configuration by dropping all packets. Then add rules to allow specific traffic patterns as required by application needs.

Lets look at an example.

![valves](img/firewall/examplerules.png)  

**Rule 1** permits externally initiated requests to a webserver behind the firewall. So the source is “any”, since we cannot anticipate a specific IP address at the time of writing the rule. The destination is the IP address of the webserver and the service specifies the port number where the service is typically hosted. That would be port 80, which is the default for a web server. If these three match an incoming packet then the action is “ACCEPT”.

**Rule 2** permits internally initiated requests out to the Internet. So the source is any ip address in the local network, which we specify as a range of IP addresses but stated here as "localnet". The destination and the service cannot be anticipated at the time of writing the rule so both are specified as “any”. If a packet matches these conditions then the action is "ACCEPT".

**Rule 3** is to deny all other traffic that does not match the previous rules. So all three match conditions are specified as “any” and the action is "REJECT".

### Question

What would happen if we re-ordered these rules? Specifically if Rule 3 was exchanged with Rule 1.

Discussion:
Rule 3 is often implemented as a "Default Policy", instead of an explicit rule in the table. The default policy applies ONLY if a packet matches NONE of the rules specified for the firewall. More on this shortly.



## Setting up the Lab Environment

> Start the Ubuntu VM. 

Login to it and open a terminal. Let's note the IP address. 

```bash
ifconfig
```
Here `eth0` is the network interface we are interested in and `lo` is the [loopback interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopback). 

Make a good note of the IP address. It should begin with `192.168`.

Let's now install a web server on this machine. We will install the Apache Http webserver with default settings.

```bash
sudo apt-get install apache2
```

Go ahead and start the web server with the following command:
```bash
service apache2 start
```

Now, let's clear all our firewall settings so that they are reset to factory settings. We will fully understand these commands a little later in the lab. But for now, fire off these command in a terminal. If promted, authenticated with the password for the steal account. These commands if successful, you will not produce any output.

```bash
sudo iptables -F INPUT
sudo iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
```
To see the effects of our firewall configuration, we need another machine that can help us make observations. 

> So now start the Kali VM. 
 
Login to it and open a terminal.

Now ping the Ubuntu VM using its IP address. [ping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_%28networking_utility%29) is a networking utility to test reachability. In the command below, replace `Ubuntu_machine_IP_address_here` with the IP address you noted above. It should begin with `192.168`.

```bash
ping Ubuntu_machine_IP_address_here
```
You should see success messages. Hit CRTL + C to close the ping process.

We also have a default apache webserver running on the Ubuntu VM on port 80. To test this, in your Kali VM open a browser and enter the IP address of the Ubuntu VM in the address bar. You should see the default Apache webpage. 

To see what else is open, we can do a port scan using [Nmap](https://nmap.org/book/man.html), which is a network scanner. To use it simply use this command in the Kali VM terminal. Keep in mind that port scanning unauthorized computers is not legal or ethical. Again, in the command below, replace `Ubuntu_machine_IP_address_here` with the IP address you noted above. It should begin with `192.168`.

```bash
nmap Ubuntu_machine_IP_address_here
```
While you can do alot [more with nmap, including firewall evasion](https://www.stationx.net/nmap-cheat-sheet/), the above command will probably report that port 22 (SSH) and port 80 (HTTP) are open on the Ubuntu VM. Since we now know that SSH is running we can open a remote shell using the following command. You should get the hang of this now, replace `Ubuntu_machine_IP_address_here` with the IP address you noted above. It should begin with `192.168`.

```bash
ssh -l steal Ubuntu_machine_IP_address_here
```

You may notice that since steal is a root account, you are not permitted to ssh using a root privileged account. 


## Working with iptables

> Switch to the Ubuntu VM

As mentioned before Linux has a firewall built right into the kernel and it is configured using the `iptables` command. Since it is a utility for privileged users, you will need to first elevate your privilege level using `sudo` prepended to the `iptables` command. Do this everytime an `iptables` command is issued. See code block below.

The built in Linux firewall can be set up in several modes like packet filtering, which is the default mode, network address translation, or mangle, where you can modify the packets as they pass through the firewall. We will focus on the IPv4 packet filtering function for this lab.

Now to view your current firewall rules in the Ubuntu VM, fire off this command in a terminal. Enter the password for the steal account if prompted.

```bash
sudo iptables -nL
```
You should see something like this:

![iptables screenshot](img/firewall/iptables.png)

What are those `-nL` commandline parameters for?  

`-n` This option tells iptables to not resolve domain names for the ip addresses in the matching rules. This results in faster display of the rules.

`-L` Lists all the rules in a specified chain. If no chain is specified then all chains are listed.

But wait! what is a **Chain**? A chain is a set of rules that can match a set of packets. It is similar to the example table that we discussed before. There are several built-in chains: INPUT, FORWARD and OUTPUT. For packet filtering, INPUT and OUTPUT chains are sufficient. As their names suggest, INPUT chain is a set of rules that match the "incoming" packets to your computer. Similarly, OUTPUT chain is a set of rules that match the "outgoing" packets. In the screenshot you can observe that currently both of these chains are empty! Also `(policy ACCEPT)` suggests that the default policy for both chains is set to ACCEPT all packets. So essentially, your firewall is WIDE OPEN at this point. For convinience, unfortunately, this is how most defalt linux installations are. We better do something about it!

> A note before we move forward: When in doubt, consult the iptables manual pages using the following command: `man iptables`. Alternatively, here is a [web version](http://ipset.netfilter.org/iptables.man.html).

Based on a whitelisting philosopy, let's begin by denying all incoming traffic by default. To do this we set the default policy for the INPUT chain to DROP

```bash
sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
```
This command uses the `-P` switch to set the default policy for the INPUT chain to DROP. This means drop all incoming packets to your computer. Let's see what the INPUT chain looks like now.

```bash
sudo iptables -nL INPUT
```
You should see something like this.

![iptables screenshot](img/firewall/inputdrop.png)

Notice `(policy DROP)`. You should NOT be able to ping or access the webserver from the Kali VM. Go ahead and confirm it by switching to the Kali VM. You may also run a port scan.

A firewall that does not allow any traffic, while secure, is not very user friendly or useful! So let's add some rules to the INPUT chain to allow incoming packets on the default web port, i.e. port 80.

```bash
sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
```

This `iptables` command follows a general structure: `iptables <option> <chain> <matching criteria> <target>`   
Let's examine each element in this structure in detail.

---
`<option> <chain>`  
Immediately following the iptables command the **option** component allows us to specify the position in which the rule will be inserted into a **chain**. For example `–A INPUT` appends the rule in the INPUT chain. `–I OUTPUT 3` inserts the rule at a specified position in the OUTPUT chain. The rule numbers start at position 1.

So this option `-I INPUT 1` says: Insert this Rule at position 1 in the INPUT chain.

> A few more useful options: `–D` to delete a rule in a specified position in the chain. `–F` is for flushing the chain, which deletes all rules in a chain.

---
`<matching criteria>`  
Next comes the **match criteria** component. This components specifies the conditions that will be used to match specific types of incoming network packets.

So this matching critiera  `-p tcp --dport 80` says: Match all packets with the TCP protocol with a destination port 80. Again, port 80 on the server is your default webserver port. We did not specify any source or destination IP addresses so it will match all IP addresses. For incoming packets, the "destination" is the server where you are authoring the iptables rules, and the "source" is the client computer. For outgoing packets, the "source" is the server and the "destination" is the client computer.

---
`<target>`  

Finally the **target** component specifies what to do if the matching criteria is met. This component is specified with a `-j` switch. It siginifies a "jump" to the target chain that follows after it. So if an incoming packet passes the matching criteria, then the next rule is specified by the value of the target chain, which can be the name of a user-defined chain or one of the special values that terminate the rule processing. The special terminating values are ACCEPT, DROP, or RETURN.

ACCEPT allows the packet in. So this target `-j ACCEPT` says: Jump to ACCEPT this packet and terminate the rule processing.

DROP and REJECT, both deny the packet and stop rule processing. But, DROP is safer than REJECT. When REJECT is used, an error packet is sent in response to the matched packet. It is best to avoid giving additional information when access is denied for any reason.

A non-terminating target chain is the LOG chain. The LOG chain helps to document any anomalies that have been detected in the kernel log. Log prefixes are specified using the following syntax:
`--log-prefix prefix`. The prefix can be about 29 characters long.

---

Let's examine the INPUT chain now.

```bash
sudo iptables -nL INPUT
```
![iptables screenshot](img/firewall/inputwebrule.png)

This output looks very similar to the example table that we discussed earlier. Here source and desination ip addresses of `0.0.0.0\0` is equivalent to "any". So the rule is equivalent to saying, match all TCP packets from **any** source to **any** desitination with a destination port 80.

If you did it right, your webserver should be accessible again from the Kali VM. Go ahead and confirm.

What about HTTPS? You would also need port 443 for HTTPS to be open. To do this we need to add another rule. This time let's append it to the INPUT chain using the `-A` option.

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
```

Notice that with `-A` you do not have to specify the rule number. The rule just gets added to the bottom of the INPUT chain. Let's look at the INPUT chain now.

```bash
sudo iptables -nL INPUT
```
![iptables screenshot](img/firewall/inputhttpsrule.png)


If your website defaults to https then you may consider making the port 443 rule the first rule. This will avoid unnecessary evaluation of the port 80 rule for most network packets.

Are these rules enough? Yes. But, just these rules can be very restrictive and may hamper debugging. For example, let's add an online software respository for Ubuntu and then try running a command to update software repositories. 

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
sudo apt-get update
```
The last command will most likely timeout due to firewall restrictions. The error messages are not likely to be useful either. So let's add a few additional firewall rules will make server administration and updates much easier. Hit `Crtl+C` to quit the update process.

First you want the server to be able to communicate with itself. This is often called sending traffic to "loopback" interface. Also, a special network adapter is dedicated to the loopback interface. You may check its name by using the `ifconfig` command. This command shows all the network adapters and associated network addresses. Below we see that the name for the loopback adapter is `lo`.

![ifconfig](img/firewall/ifconfig.png)

To author a permissive firewall rule on the INPUT chain we use the `-i lo` matching criteria for the input loopback interface, with the target ACCEPT.

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
```

Now switch to the Kali VM and see if you can ping the Ubuntu machine. 

It should fail. But it would be nice to be able to "ping" the Ubuntu VM from any other machine to determine reachability. "Pings" are based on the ICMP protocol and the specific type of message is `echo-request`. Hence the matching criteria becomes `-p icmp --icmp-type echo-request`.

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j ACCEPT
```
> You may now try to ping the Ubuntu VM from Kali VM again to see what happens.

Finally, we want to allow all "incoming" packets that are in response to a internal server request. Such response network packets are said to be in a `ESTABLISHED` or `RELATED` state. Such a firewall rule requires tracking the state of various network connections. Hence, we invoke the `conntrack` module using the `-m` switch. The entire matching criteria is specified as `-m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED`. The `--ctstate` switch is an abbreviation for "connection state".

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
```
These rules should make your server much more convenient to operate. Try running the update command now.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```
It should succeed now.

### Non-terminating Targets

A non-terminating target is LOG, i.e. rule traversal continues at the next rule. The LOG chain helps to document any anomalies that have been detected in the kernel log, but does not filter the traffic. If no other additional rule matches the packet, then the default policy is applied. This may also fill up the kernel log, so use with caution. Also to drop the logged packets you have to use two separate rules with the same matching criteria, first using target LOG and then DROP.

Log prefixes are specified using the following syntax: `--log-prefix prefix`. This option allows us to prefix log messages with the specified prefix; up to 29 letters long, and useful for distinguishing messages in the logs.

Let's say we wanted to know if someone was attempting a telnet connection through port 23 on our machine. Telnet is a very insecure protocol and often left open as a maintenance backdoor in devices with poor security. So, to log all telnet attempts we can use the following command:

```bash
sudo iptables –A INPUT –p tcp --dport 23 -j LOG --log-prefix “Attempted Telnet connection: ”
```

The above command should be easy to understand now. But, where is the log message generated when somebody attempts to make a telnet connection attempt? First, let's trigger this rule.

> Switch to Kali VM.

In a terminal in the Kali VM, issue this command to make a telnet connection with the Ubuntu VM. 

```bash
telnet Ubuntu_machine_IP_address_here 
```
The connection will fail as there is no telnet service running on the Ubuntu VM. But it should have triggered the firewall LOG rule in the Ubuntu VM to make a successful log entry of this attempt. Let's see if this is the case.

> Switch to Ubuntu VM. 

Kernel log messages in the Ubuntu VM can be viewed using the following command in a terminal. We filter the messages with the "attempted" keyword that we put into the log-prefix before.

```bash
dmesg | grep –i attempted
```
You will see that many details are now available about the connection attempt. Such logs allow detection of rouge connections or scanning attempts. 

There many other advanced firewall rules that can be authored. But these set of rules should be sufficient to demonstrate the inner workings of a Firewall. We have also managed to significantly reduce the exposed ports of the Ubuntu VM to those that are absolutely necessary for it to work. Nothing more. Any IPv4 network traffic that does not match our rules will be processed by the default policy. In our case, the default policy is DROP.

For more details on `iptables`, consult these web resources:

[Ubuntu iptables Wiki](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo)  
[CentOS iptables Wiki](https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Network/IPTables)

Discussion:
Now step back and ponder this question: Have I taken care of all network openings into the server?

Let's check something. `ss` is a great linux network utility. Among other things it shows a summary of network statistics.

```bash
ss -s
```

Notice anything in the output?

![iptables screenshot](img/firewall/ssoutput.png)

How about now?

![iptables screenshot](img/firewall/ssoutput2.png)


Turns out we controlled the IPv4 network interface, but completely forgot about **IPv6**. This happens a lot in real systems too. In particular, while port 22 for ssh access may be blocked in IPv4, but it is often left accessible using a IPv6 address. Check if that is the case with your server.

For illustration, let us set the default INPUT chain policy to drop.

```bash
sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
# Flush all rules in the INPUT chain
sudo iptables -F INPUT
```

> Switch to the Kali VM

Run a nmap scan

```bash
nmap Ubuntu_machine_IP_address_here
```
No open ports should be reported. 

> Switch back to the Ubuntu VM 

In the terminal:

```bash
ifconfig
```
Record the IPv6 address. It will looks something simillar to this: `fe80::250:56ff:fea0:14a`. Ignore the forward slash and any numbers after it.

> Switch to Kali VM 

Run a nmap scan for IPv6 interfaces using the `-6` option.

```bash
nmap -6 IPV6_Ubuntu_machine_address_here
```
Much to our surprise both ports, 22 and 80 will be reported open now!

> Switch back to Ubuntu VM

Run the following command to check the state of IPv6 interface. Notice the `6` in the `ip6tables` command.

```bash
sudo ip6tables -nL
```
![iptables screenshot](img/firewall/ip6tablesoutput.png)

The IPv6 network interface is WIDE OPEN!!!

Let's fix this by setting the default policy on IPv6 INPUT chain to DROP.

```bash
sudo ip6tables -P INPUT DROP
```

Check if the settings were correctly applied.

```bash
sudo ip6tables -nL
```
You can switch to the Kali VM and run a IPv6 nmap scan again to confirm that no open ports are advertised on the IPv6 interface.


## Return the settings back to what they were

Let's clear all our firewall settings so that they do not interfere with future labs.

```bash
# Flush all rules in the INPUT chain
sudo iptables -F INPUT
# Set default policy to accept
sudo iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT

# Set the default policy for IPv6 INPUT chain
sudo ip6tables -P INPUT ACCEPT
```

### Making Firewall Settings Persistent (Optional)

Unless you commit your iptables rules to a specific location, they will be reset upon machine restart. To save the rules the following commands will work on Ubuntu OS.

```bash
sudo iptables-save > rules.v4
sudo cp rules.v4 /etc/iptables/rules.v4
sudo ip6tables-save > rules.v6
sudo cp rules.v6 /etc/iptables/rules.v6
```

Once saved, these rules can be restored using the iptables-restore command. That's it for Firewalls in this lab. Happy Surfing.

> Firewalls are an essential component of "Defense-in-Depth" strategy. It can certainly slowdown an attacker. However, firewalls cannot keep a determined adversary out. There are many ways in which [firewalls can be abused and easily bypassed](https://pentestlab.blog/2012/04/02/nmap-techniques-for-avoiding-firewalls/). Such attacks need to be constantly monitored using Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Network Monitoring solutions. The final line of defense is applications built using secure coding practices and proper encryption implementations.
